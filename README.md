## Some Frequently Asked Questions
1) My pull request was labeled as invalid by a maintainer, why doesn’t it count?
If a repository maintainer decides a pull request you made was spammy or an unhelpful contribution to the project, they can add an invalid or spam label to your PR. This lets us know they do not think your pull request is a quality contribution, so it will not count toward Hacktoberfest.

2) Why is my pull request in a maturing state on my profile?
In an effort to reduce spam and help maintainers, we’ve introduced a two week review period for all pull requests. Once you have submitted an eligible pull request (ready for review, not draft), the fourteen-day review window begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label any spammy pull requests as invalid. If your pull request is not marked invalid during that window, it will contribute toward the four you need to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If during this period your pull request is labeled as invalid, you will need to submit another eligible pull request (or resolve the issue with the current pull request), at which point the review period will start again.

3)My PR was labeled as invalid, but it isn’t. What should I do?
If a maintainer labels your pull request as invalid or spam, but you don’t believe this is correct, please begin a conversation with the maintainer within the PR and explain your position.

4) What is open source?
Open source refers to source code that is publicly accessible and allows anyone to inspect, modify or learn from it. Open source projects encourage collaboration and the freedom to use the software for any purpose you wish.

5) My pull request is marked as being on an excluded repository. What does this mean?
Unfortunately, your pull request was made on a repository that doesn’t align with the core values of Hacktoberfest. We’ve decided that pull requests made to this repository will not count toward completing the challenge.
